<h1>Hi Friends</h1>
<p>My name is Kyle Taber and I'm a student at Savvy Coders. I'm currently learning how to program in several different languages including javascript, python, css, and html. My end goal is to get into a top twenty graduate school for computer science after I've been working in industry for a few years. </p>
